#Introduction

this is my hand-in for mandatory 1
The goal is to create a documentaion page.

I believe documentation should be served staticly.
So i am trying to create a application that combines markdown for writing the documentation and html templates for adding static html elements fx navigation. The results should be staticly served documentation.

This will be done through filehandling on the server. Markdown and html will be combined to new html files available at http://thispage/public/Introduction.html
