# Introduction

This is my hand-in for mandatory 1
The goal is to create a documentaion page.

You can access the different pages in Navigation to the left.


what is to be created is a login and edit functionality.
for that I imagine a edit button for each element in navigation available when logged in.
This should open a page with a text area containing current data in corresponding markdown file and a save button.
