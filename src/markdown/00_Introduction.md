# Introduction

This is my hand-in for mandatory 1
The goal is to create a documentaion page.

You can access the different pages in Navigation to the left.

For now documentation pages are located in ./src/markdown/, it could be cool to allow for loading from external directories, so when running the program you could define which local directory your markdown files were in. Or even further load the files from a remote directory from maybe github.

what is to be created is a login and edit functionality.
for that I imagine a edit button for each element in navigation available when logged in.
This should open a page with a text area containing current data in corresponding markdown file and a save button.
